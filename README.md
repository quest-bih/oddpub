ODDPub is a text mining algorithm that parses a set of publications and detects
which publications disseminated Open Data or Open Code together with the
publication. It is tailored towards biomedical literature.

## Authors

Nico Riedel, Vladislav Nachev, Miriam Kip, Evgeny Bobrov (evgeny.bobrov@bih-charite.de) - QUEST Center for Transforming Biomedical Research, Berlin Institute of Health

## Publication

More information on the development and validation of the algorithm can be found in the publication https://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-042. The related training and validation datasets can be found under https://osf.io/yv5rx/.

## Installation

The latest version of the algorithm is structured as an R package and can easily be installed with the following command:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools") # if devtools currently not installed
devtools::install_github("quest-bih/oddpub")
```

## Description

The algorithm searches for several categories of similar keywords in each 
sentence. Multiple categories have to match for a single sentence to trigger a 
detection. Among keyword categories are categories for specific biomedical
repositories as well as their corresponding accession numbers (as regular
expressions), general-purpose repositories or different file formats typically
used to distribute raw data in the supplement.

Additionally, Open Code dissemination is detected using keywords categories
for source code or code repositories.

## Usage

The package exposes four functions that allow the following workflow:

``` r
oddpub::pdf_convert(PDF_folder, output_folder)
```
Converts PDFs contained in one folder to txt-files and saves them into the output folder.

``` r
PDF_text_sentences <- oddpub::pdf_load(pdf_text_folder)
```
Loads all text files from given folder.

``` r
open_data_results <- oddpub::open_data_search(PDF_text_sentences)
```
Actual Open Data detection. Returns for each file if Open Data or Open Code is detected. Additionally returns the identified Open Data/Code categories as well as the detected sentences, which can be deactivated using the additional parameter ```detected_sentences = FALSE```.

``` r
future::plan(multisession)
open_data_results <- oddpub::open_data_search(PDF_text_sentences)
```
Paralellized version of the algorithm that starts several parallel processes with the use of the packages `future` and `furrr`.

To validate the algorithm, we manually screened a sample of 792 publications that were randomly selected from PubMed. On this validation dataset, our algorithm detects Open Data publications with a sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity of 0.97.

The algorithm has been updated in 2024. A new validation is planned for early 2025.

## Detailed description of the keywords

In the following, we give an overview over the different parts of the keywords used in the algorithm

Those are the combined keyword categories that are searched in the full text. If a hit was detected in any of these combined categories, the paper is flagged as Open Data. For definitions of the individual keyword categories, see below.

| Combined Keyword Category | Keywords |
|---------------------------|----------|
| Field-specific repository        | FIELD_SPECIFIC_REPO NEAR (ACCESSION_NR OR WEBLINK) NEAR (AVAILABLE NOT (NOT_AVAILABLE OR WAS_AVAILABLE OR REUSE)) NEAR (DATA OR NOT (MISC_NOT_DATA OR NOT PROTOCOL OR SUPPLEMENT OR SOURCE_CODE OR GRANT)) |
| General-purpose repository | REPOSITORIES NEAR (AVAILABLE NOT (NOT_AVAILABLE OR WAS_AVAILABLE OR REUSE)) NEAR (DATA OR NOT (MISC_NOT_DATA OR PROTOCOL OR SUPPLEMENT OR SOURCE_CODE))) |

The previous two categories are the only potentially open data references in line with our criteria.
Further categories of interest that may refer to data that do not satisfy our criteria, but are detected and reported, are listed below.

| Combined Keyword Category | Keywords |
|---------------------------|----------|
| Dataset |	(DATASET_NAME OUTER_SYM DATASET_NUMBER) OR SUPPLEMENTAL_DATASET |
| Supplemental table or data |	SUPPLEMENTAL_TABLE NEAR_WD(10) (FILE_FORMATS OR ALL_DATA) |
| Supplementary raw/full data with specific file format | (ALL_DATA NOT NOT_DATA) NEAR_WD(10) FILE_FORMATS |
| Dataset on Github |	DATA NEAR GITHUB NEAR (AVAILABLE NOT (NOT_AVAILABLE OR WAS_AVAILABLE)) |
| Upon request | UPON_REQUEST |
| Re-use | REUSE_STATEMENTS OR (WAS_AVAILABLE NEAR_WD(30) (ACCESSION_NR OR FIELD_SPECIFIC_REPO OR REPOSITORIES OR WEBLINK OR CITATION OR GITHUB)) NOT GRANT|
| Unknown/misspecified source | DATA NEAR AVAILABLE NEAR WEBLINK NOT (NOT_AVAILABLE OR ACCESSION_NR OR SUPPLEMENT OR Field-specific repository OR General-purpose repository or Dataset on Github) |

Further, experimental categories such as re-use and unknown/misspecified source are being actively developed
and their final definitions will be updated after validation.

Additionally, the detection of Open Code statements is done with the following keywords:

| Combined Keyword Category | Keywords |
|---------------------------|----------|
| Source-code availability  | SOURCE_CODE NEAR AVAILABLE NOT (NOT_AVAILABLE OR WAS_AVAILABLE OR REUSE) NEAR (NOT UPON_REQUEST OR GIT_OR_URL) |
| Supplementary Source-code | SOURCE_CODE NEAR SUPPLEMENT |
| All Open Code keywords combined | SOURCE_CODE NEAR (SUPPLEMENT OR (AVAILABLE NOT (NOT_AVAILABLE OR WAS_AVAILABLE OR UPON_REQUEST)) |

Individual keyword categories (out of date): 

| Definitions    | Description  |  Keywords  |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| x NEAR y       | Are the two keywords (or groups of keywords) x and y in the same sentence? | |
| x NEAR_WD(n) y | Second definition of NEAR. This time counts how many words are between the two keywords. If the number lies below a cutoff value (e.g. 10 words), the two input words are considered "near". This additional definition is needegit d for cases like "S2 Table. Raw data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158039.s002 (XLS)" | |
| NOT y          | y is not included in the same sentence | |
